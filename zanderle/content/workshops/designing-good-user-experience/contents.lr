excerpt:

A workshop done at two conferences. The goal was to teach developers some basic UX development techniques which they can start using in their projects (even if they don't have a dedicated UX team).

This was presented at [DjangoCon US 2016](https://2016.djangocon.us/schedule/presentation/56/) and DjangoCon Europe 2017. It was very well received both times.
