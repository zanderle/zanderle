Teaching is one of my favorite things. I love figuring out what's the best way to present a complex topic to someone else. Which is why preparing workshops for a specific audience (and tailoring it to their needs) is something I love doing.

[I'm available for hire](/hire-me), if you're interested in workshops/trainings for your company.

Here's a list of some of the workshops and trainings that I've done in the past.
