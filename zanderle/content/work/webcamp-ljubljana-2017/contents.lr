excerpt: I was part of the 2017's WebCamp Ljubljana organising team. I was on the talk committee, responsible for writing a Call for Proposals, selecting talks and helping speakers be awesome. I am especially proud of the record number of submitted proposals and the fact that women comprised  35% of the final speaker lineup.
